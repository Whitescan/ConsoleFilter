# ConsoleFilter

A lightweight plugin to filter and hide console messages and remove old log files.

# Requirements

- Java 17
- Paper or Waterfall

# Compatibility

Spigot, BungeeCord and forks of Paper / Waterfall may work, but aren't tested or supported.
I have no interest in providing support for ancient Minecraft versions so don't bother asking.

# Commands

Spigot / Paper:
/reloadconsolefilter - Reload the configuration

BungeeCord / Waterfall:
/breloadconsolefilter - Reload the configuration

Velocity:
/vreloadconsolefilter - Reload the configuration

# Permissions

- consolefilter.reload - Allow the usage of the config reload command (both platforms)

# Why are things the way they are?

There are plugins that work in a similar way, but they don't work the way I want them to.
It's mainly for my personal use, so I won't be working on any feature requests.
This is an all-in-one-solution for both Waterfall and Paper.
