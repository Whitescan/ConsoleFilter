# ConsoleFilter
A lightweight plugin to filter and hide console messages

# Java Version
Java 17 is used within this plugin and is strongly recommended.

# Minecraft Support
Currently this plugin only supports Spigot / Paper and Waterfall (BungeeCord Fork from PaperMC).

# Why are things the way they are?
Evenso there are plugins on spigot that do similar already, they don't work the way I want them to. This is a all in solution for both Proxy and Backend.
I have no interest in providing ancient 1.8 support.
BungeeCord does not use org.apache.logging.log4j framework and I do.
